Here's our final project submission ...
Due to our previous project loss, we decided to create a different app.

This is the implementation of a RESTful API's with PHP interface and SQL server hosting.

On the SQL server is a database of 100 different rows, each with 30 columns.

This represent the character of a popular video game and this app is intended to help new players out.

We had more features planned, and they wouldn't be hard to implement, we just got caught up with time and mostly focusing on razorsquare.
